# CS50x Python Course Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my CS50x Python Course Repository! This repository tracks my progress and assignments as I work through the "Introduction to Programming with Python" course, led by Professor David J. Malan at Harvard University. Whether you're a fellow learner or someone interested in my coding journey, feel free to explore the code and notes here.

## Course Overview
The course covers a range of fundamental programming concepts, including:

- Reading and writing code
- Testing and debugging
- Functions, arguments, and return values
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and Boolean expressions
- Loops
- Exception handling
- Bug fixing and unit tests
- Third-party libraries
- Regular expressions for data validation and extraction
- Object-oriented programming with classes, objects, methods, and properties
- File I/O operations

## How to Run the Code
If you want to run any of the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/CS50x-Python.git
```
2. Navigate the directory structure
```bash
  $ cd directoryName
  $ cd ..
  # etc etc
``` 
3. Execute the Python Program
```bash
  $ python nameOfFile.py
```
